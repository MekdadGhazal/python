template = As an expert programmer, you are tasked with generating a git commit message. Analyze the following code changes (git diff) and generate a concise, descriptive commit message. Follow the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., 'feat:', 'fix:', 'docs:', 'refactor:'). The response should ONLY be the commit message itself, without any introduction or explanation. Git Diff: ```diff {diff_content} ```
